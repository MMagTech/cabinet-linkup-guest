#
# REPORT ONLY, NEVER A FAILURE: prints every source file over LIMIT lines, longest first, and always
# exits 0. Given a pull request's base and head (.github/workflows/build.yml runs it on every pull
# request), it also says how much each grew in the pull request, and on GitHub a file it grew is a
# warning on the pull request and the list is the run's summary.
#
# WHY. CabinetOS's main.cpp reached 20,018 lines one small addition at a time before its #398 split it
# into files named for their jobs (docs/decisions/2026-11-12-checks-hold-the-structure.md). A long file
# is not wrong by itself, but new code that is a job of its own belongs in a file of its own
# (CONTRIBUTING.md, "The rules"), and a file growing past this size is the sign to look. This is
# CabinetOS's own check, with this repository's folders.
#
# A SOURCE FILE is a tracked file under FOLDERS with a source file's ending. VENDORED files are
# another project's code, kept as it is; they are left out. cabinetos/ is never read: it is CabinetOS's.
